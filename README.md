This was a pre-release Caffe branch for fully convolutional networks (FCNs); however, the needed FCN features are now included in the Caffe master branch.
See the [fcn.berkeleyvision.org repo](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org) for details, reference models, and code.

This includes unmerged PRs and no guarantees.
Everything here is subject to change, including the history of this branch.
Consider PR #2016 for reducing memory usage.

See `future.sh` for details.
